## Overview

CiteScore uses a hybrid billing model that combines plan-based feature access with a Premium Credit system for AI-powered operations. Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation. Operations that consume AI resources deduct credits from your balance.

## Plan Tiers

CiteScore offers four plan tiers:

| Feature | Free | Starter | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Price** | $0 | $49/mo | $199/mo | Custom |
| **Brand Profiles** | 1 | 1 | Up to 10 | Unlimited |
| **AI Models** | Standard only | Standard only | All models | All models |
| **AEO Audits** | 1 (one-time) | 1/month free | Included | Unlimited |
| **Website GEO Audits** | — | 1/month free | Included | Unlimited |
| **Content Generation** | — | Included | Included | Included |
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | — | — | Yes | Yes |
| **Support** | Community | Email | Priority | Dedicated |

### Free Plan

The Free plan provides a single AEO audit to experience CiteScore. It is designed as a funnel entry point — no credit card required. After the initial audit, upgrade to continue using the platform.

### Starter Plan

The Starter plan is for individual brands or small teams beginning their AI visibility work. It includes one brand profile, standard AI models, and monthly free audits.

### Pro Plan

The Pro plan is for teams managing multiple brands or requiring access to all AI models. It supports up to 10 brand profiles and includes BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for using your own AI API keys.

### Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan provides unlimited brands, unlimited audits, and dedicated support. Contact sales for custom pricing.

## Premium Credits

Premium Credits are consumed by AI-powered operations. Each operation has a defined credit cost:

### Credit Costs

| Operation | Credit Cost | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **AEO Audit** | 10 credits | Runs 20 questions through an AI model |
| **Website GEO Audit (full)** | 10 credits | Audits all discovered pages in batch |
| **Page GEO Audit (individual)** | 2 credits | Audits a single page |
| **Content Generation** | Varies | Depends on content length and complexity |
| **Benchmark Test Run** | Varies | Per-question AI model queries |
| **Image Generation** | Varies | AI-generated images for content |
| **Strategy Generation** | Varies | AI-powered strategy creation |
| **Brand DNA Generation** | Varies | AI-powered brand summary |

### Monthly Allocation

Each paid plan includes a monthly credit allocation that resets at the start of each billing cycle. Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.

### BYOK and Credits

On the Pro and Enterprise plans, you can configure your own AI API keys (Bring Your Own Key). When using your own keys:

- Operations use your API key instead of CiteScore's
- Credit consumption may be reduced or waived for operations using your own keys
- You pay the AI provider directly for usage

## Purchasing Additional Credits

If you exhaust your monthly allocation, you can purchase additional (bonus) credits:

- Bonus credits are available as one-time purchases
- They are applied to your current billing period
- Bonus credits are consumed after your monthly allocation is depleted

## Usage Tracking

CiteScore tracks your usage in real time. You can monitor your consumption from the **Billing & Usage** section of your workspace settings:

- Current period credit balance
- Credits used by operation type
- Content generations this period
- Benchmark tests run
- Website and page audits run
- Images generated
