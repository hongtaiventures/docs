## Overview

This guide walks you through the essential steps to start using CiteScore: creating an account, setting up a brand profile, and running your first AEO audit. You will have a baseline AI visibility score within minutes.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [citescore.ai/signup](https://citescore.ai/signup) and create an account using your email or Google login.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workspace">
    After signing in, you will be prompted to create a workspace. This is where your brands, audits, and content live. Choose a name that represents your team or organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create a Brand Profile

The onboarding flow guides you through creating your first [Brand Profile](/getting-started/core-concepts#brand-profile). You will provide:

1. **Brand name** — your company or product name as it should appear in AI answers
2. **Website URL** — your primary domain
3. **Product one-liner** — a single sentence describing what you offer
4. **Product description** — a more detailed explanation of your product or service
5. **Target audiences** — who your product serves
6. **Differentiators** — what makes you distinct from competitors
7. **Competitors** — brands you compete with for AI visibility
8. **Keywords** — primary keywords for your category

<Info>
  Be specific and accurate with your brand information. CiteScore uses this data to generate relevant audit questions, content strategies, and benchmarks. Vague or generic inputs produce less useful outputs.
</Info>

After submitting your brand details, CiteScore generates your [Brand DNA](/getting-started/core-concepts#brand-dna) — a structured summary that informs all downstream features.

## Step 3: Run Your First AEO Audit

Once your Brand Profile is set up:

1. Navigate to your brand's **AEO Audits** section
2. Click **Run Audit**
3. Select the AI model to test against (default: GPT-4o Mini)
4. The audit generates 20 category-neutral questions and runs them through the selected AI model

The audit typically completes within a few minutes. Each question is evaluated for whether your brand was mentioned and in what position.

## Step 4: Read Your Results

Your audit results include:

- **AEO Score** — your overall visibility score from 0 to 100
- **Mention rate** — the percentage of questions where your brand appeared
- **Average rank** — your average position when mentioned (Primary, Secondary, or Listed)
- **Per-question breakdown** — the AI's full response for each question, with your brand's mention status highlighted

### What to Look For

| Pattern | What It Means | Suggested Action |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| High score (70+) | Strong AI visibility | Maintain with monthly audits |
| Moderate score (40–70) | Visible but inconsistent | Identify gap questions, create targeted content |
| Low score (under 40) | Limited AI presence | Review brand positioning, build authoritative content |
| Mentioned but never primary | Recognized but not differentiated | Strengthen competitive positioning |
| Missing for specific question types | Gaps in content coverage | Create content addressing those question angles |

2. **Analyze** — identify gaps and patterns in your audit results
3. **Strategize** — generate or update your content strategy based on findings
4. **Create** — generate content targeting your specific visibility gaps
5. **Publish** — deploy content to your site
6. **Re-audit** — measure the impact after 4–8 weeks

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does an AEO audit take?">
    Most audits complete within two to five minutes. The audit runs 20 questions through the selected AI model and analyzes each response for brand mentions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I run audits on multiple AI models?">
    Yes. You can run separate audits against different models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity) to see how your visibility varies across platforms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my AEO Score is zero?">
    A score of zero means the AI model did not mention your brand for any of the 20 test questions. This is common for newer brands or those with limited online presence. Focus on building category-relevant content and third-party mentions, then re-audit after a few weeks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often should I run audits?">
    Monthly audits provide a good cadence for tracking trends. Run additional audits after significant content changes or new product launches to measure their impact.
