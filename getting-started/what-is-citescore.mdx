## Overview

CiteScore is an Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform. It helps brands measure, track, and improve how often AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity mention and recommend them.

When users ask AI assistants questions such as "What is the best CRM for startups?" or "Which analytics tool should I use?", the AI generates a direct answer that may mention specific brands. CiteScore measures whether your brand appears in those answers, and provides the tools to improve your visibility.

## What CiteScore Does

CiteScore provides a complete workflow for managing your brand's AI presence:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Measure AI Visibility">
    Run [AEO Audits](/product/aeo-audits) that test 20 category-neutral questions across AI models. Each audit produces an [AEO Score](/reference/scoring-methodology) from 0 to 100 that quantifies your brand's AI visibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Your Website">
    Run a [Website GEO Audit](/product/website-geo-audit) that crawls your site, evaluates each page for AI-readiness, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Strategy">
    Generate AI-informed [content strategies](/product/strategy) with keyword themes, question clusters, and content type recommendations tailored to your brand and category.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Content">
    Create [AEO-optimized content](/product/content-generation) including blog posts, landing pages, and FAQ sections designed to increase your chances of being cited by AI systems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Progress">
    Run monthly audits to monitor how your AEO Score changes over time and correlate improvements with your content activities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who CiteScore is For

CiteScore serves marketing teams and agencies responsible for brand visibility in AI-driven discovery channels:

- **SaaS companies** tracking whether AI recommends their product over competitors
- **E-commerce brands** monitoring AI product recommendations in their category
- **Marketing agencies** offering AEO audits and strategy as a service to clients
- **Content teams** generating AI-optimized content at scale
- **Brand managers** reporting on AI visibility as a channel metric

## Why AI Visibility Matters

As more users turn to AI assistants for research and recommendations, a new discovery channel has emerged alongside traditional search. Brands that are mentioned in AI-generated answers reach users who may never visit a search engine results page.

Unlike traditional search where you appear somewhere on a ranked list, AI answers mention only a handful of brands or none at all. You are either cited or invisible. There is no page two.

CiteScore exists to make this new channel measurable and actionable.
