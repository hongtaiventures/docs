## Overview

This page defines the key concepts and terminology used throughout CiteScore. Understanding these terms is essential for interpreting audit results, building strategies, and getting value from the platform.

## AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

AEO stands for Answer Engine Optimization. It is the practice of optimizing content so that AI-powered answer engines cite your brand when generating responses to user questions.

Answer engines include AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. Unlike traditional search engines that return ranked lists of links, answer engines synthesize information and provide direct answers — often mentioning specific brands.

AEO focuses on whether and how your brand appears in those synthesized answers.

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It describes the same fundamental practice as AEO, with emphasis on the generative nature of modern AI systems.

Where AEO highlights the "answer engine" paradigm, GEO highlights the "generative AI" technology. The two terms are effectively interchangeable. CiteScore uses both depending on context:

- **AEO** when referring to audits and scoring (AEO Audit, AEO Score)
- **GEO** when referring to website-level optimization (Website GEO Audit)

## AEO Score

An AEO Score is a 0–100 metric that quantifies how visible your brand is in AI-generated answers. It is calculated by running 20 category-neutral questions through an AI model and scoring each response based on where your brand appears:

| Position | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | 5 | Your brand is featured first or most prominently |
| Secondary | 3 | Your brand is mentioned as a strong alternative |
| Listed | 2 | Your brand is included in a list of options |
| Not mentioned | 0 | Your brand does not appear |

With 20 questions at a maximum of 5 points each, the maximum score is 100. For detailed scoring methodology, see [Scoring Methodology](/reference/scoring-methodology).

### Interpreting Your Score

| Range | Visibility Level |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0–30 | Low — AI rarely mentions your brand |
| 30–50 | Emerging — occasional mentions, significant room to grow |
| 50–70 | Moderate — regular mentions, competitive position |
| 70–85 | Strong — frequently mentioned, often prominently |
| 85–100 | Excellent — dominant in AI recommendations |

Scores vary by industry and competitive landscape. Focus on improvement over time rather than comparing across categories.

## Brand Profile

A Brand Profile is your brand's record in CiteScore. It contains:

- **Name and website** — your brand identity
- **Product description** — a one-liner and detailed description of what you offer
- **Target audiences** — who your product serves
- **Differentiators** — what sets you apart from competitors
- **Competitors** — brands you compete with for AI visibility
- **Keywords** — primary and long-tail keywords for your category
- **Tone and voice** — your brand's communication style
- **Allowed and forbidden claims** — guardrails for generated content

Brand Profiles power every feature in CiteScore. Audits test questions relevant to your brand. Content generation follows your voice guidelines. Strategy recommendations align with your positioning.

## Brand DNA

Brand DNA is a structured summary generated from your Brand Profile. It distills your brand's positioning, audience, differentiators, and voice into a format that CiteScore's AI systems use when generating content and strategy.

Brand DNA ensures consistency. Every piece of content, every strategy recommendation, and every audit question set is informed by your Brand DNA so that outputs align with your actual brand positioning.

## Benchmark Questions

Benchmark Questions are category-neutral questions used to test your AI visibility. They are designed to mirror how real users ask AI assistants about products and services in your category.

Examples for a project management tool:
- "What are the best project management tools for remote teams?"
- "How do I manage tasks across multiple projects?"
- "What software do product managers use to track work?"

Key characteristics of benchmark questions:
- They **do not mention your brand name** — this tests organic visibility
- They cover multiple angles: category queries, problem queries, use-case queries, and audience queries
- Standard audit sets contain **20 questions**
- They can be AI-generated based on your Brand Profile or manually curated

For more, see [Benchmark Questions](/product/benchmark-questions).

## Content Clusters

Content Clusters are groups of related content organized around a central topic. Each cluster has:

- **A pillar page** — the main, comprehensive page on the topic
- **Supporting pages** — focused pages that link back to the pillar
- **An internal linking map** — how pages within the cluster connect

Content clusters help AI systems understand your topical authority by creating a web of related, well-linked content.

## Premium Credits

Premium Credits are the currency used for AI-powered operations in CiteScore. Different operations consume different amounts of credits:

- **AEO Audits** — run AI model queries to test your visibility
- **Website GEO Audits** — analyze your website pages for AI readiness
- **Content Generation** — generate articles, blog posts, and other content
- **Benchmark Test Runs** — test individual questions against AI models
- **Image Generation** — create visuals for your content

Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation. Additional credits can be purchased as needed. See [Credit System and Plans](/reference/credit-system) for details.

- Team members with role-based access (Owner, Admin, Member)
- Brand Profiles (one or multiple depending on your plan)
- Billing and subscription settings
- AI model configuration (including BYOK — Bring Your Own Key)
