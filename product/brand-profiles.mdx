title: "Brand Profiles"
description: "Brand Profiles are the foundation of CiteScore. They store your brand's identity, positioning, competitors, and voice guidelines — powering audits, strategy, and content generation."

## Overview

A Brand Profile is your brand's central record in CiteScore. It contains the information that powers every other feature: AEO audits use it to generate relevant questions, content generation follows its voice guidelines, and strategy recommendations align with its positioning.

Every workspace can contain one or more Brand Profiles depending on your plan. Agencies managing multiple clients typically create one profile per client brand.

## Creating a Brand Profile

When you create a brand profile, you provide the following information:

### Identity

- **Brand name** — the name as it should appear in AI answers (e.g., "Notion", not "Notion Labs Inc.")
- **Website** — your primary domain
- **Product one-liner** — a single sentence describing what you offer
- **Product description** — a detailed explanation covering features, use cases, and value proposition

### Targeting

- **Target audiences** — the personas your product serves (e.g., "product managers at mid-market SaaS companies")
- **Differentiators** — what sets you apart from competitors
- **Competitors** — brands you compete with for AI visibility (used in audit analysis)

### Keywords

- **Primary keywords** — the main category terms for your product
- **Long-tail keywords** — more specific phrases your audience uses

### Voice and Compliance

- **Tone and voice** — your brand's communication style (e.g., "professional", "conversational")
- **Allowed claims** — statements your brand can make
- **Forbidden claims** — statements to avoid in generated content
- **Banned words** — terms never to use
- **Preferred words** — terms to use instead of common alternatives

<Info>
  Accuracy matters. CiteScore uses every field in your Brand Profile to customize outputs. Generic descriptions produce generic audits and content. Specific, detailed inputs produce actionable results.

## Brand DNA

After you create or update a Brand Profile, CiteScore generates **Brand DNA** — a structured summary of your brand's positioning, audience, differentiators, and competitive landscape.

Brand DNA serves as the context layer for AI operations. When CiteScore generates content, creates strategy recommendations, or formulates audit questions, it draws on your Brand DNA to ensure relevance and consistency.

You can view and regenerate Brand DNA from your brand's overview page.

## Competitor Tracking

Each Brand Profile can include tracked competitors. When you add competitors:

- AEO audit results show which competitors were mentioned alongside (or instead of) your brand
- Benchmark test results track competitor mention frequency
- You can monitor which questions trigger competitor recommendations

Competitor data helps you understand not just your own visibility, but the competitive landscape in AI responses.

## Managing Multiple Brands

Agencies and multi-brand organizations can manage multiple Brand Profiles within a single workspace:

| Plan | Brand Profiles |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Starter | 1 |
| Pro | Up to 10 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

Each brand operates independently with its own audits, benchmarks, strategies, and content.
