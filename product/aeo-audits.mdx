## Overview

An AEO Audit (Answer Engine Optimization Audit) is a systematic test of your brand's AI visibility. It runs 20 category-neutral [benchmark questions](/product/benchmark-questions) through an AI model and analyzes each response for whether your brand is mentioned, where it appears, and which competitors are cited.

Each audit produces an [AEO Score](/reference/scoring-methodology) from 0 to 100 and a per-question breakdown that reveals exactly where your brand is visible and where gaps exist.

## How an AEO Audit Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate questions">
    CiteScore generates 20 questions based on your [Brand Profile](/product/brand-profiles). Questions are category-neutral — they do not mention your brand name. This tests organic visibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Query the AI model">
    Each question is sent to the selected AI model (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Perplexity). CiteScore captures the full response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze responses">
    Each response is analyzed for:
    - Whether your brand was mentioned
    - Your position (Primary, Secondary, Listed, or Not Mentioned)
    - Which competitors appeared
    - The context and sentiment of your mention
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate score">
    Results are aggregated into your AEO Score using the [scoring methodology](/reference/scoring-methodology): 5 points for Primary, 3 for Secondary, 2 for Listed, 0 for Not Mentioned.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported AI Models

CiteScore supports auditing across four major AI providers:

| Provider | Model | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini | Most widely used; good baseline |
| **Google** | Gemini | Integrates with Google Search data |
| **Anthropic** | Claude | Known for nuanced, balanced responses |
| **Perplexity** | Perplexity | Always cites sources; web-retrieval based |

Different models produce different results. Running audits across multiple models gives a complete picture of your AI visibility landscape.

## Reading Audit Results

### Overall Metrics

- **AEO Score (0–100)** — your aggregate visibility score
- **Mention count** — how many of the 20 questions mentioned your brand
- **Average rank** — your average position across all questions

### Per-Question Breakdown

For each of the 20 questions, you can see:

- The exact question asked
- The full AI response
- Whether your brand was detected
- Your rank bucket (Primary, Secondary, Listed, or None)
- Points awarded
- Competitors mentioned in the response

### Rank Buckets

| Bucket | Points | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Primary** | 5 | Your brand is the first or most prominently featured recommendation |
| **Secondary** | 3 | Your brand is mentioned as a strong alternative (2nd or 3rd position) |
| **Listed** | 2 | Your brand is included in a broader list of options |
| **None** | 0 | Your brand was not mentioned |

## Interpreting Patterns

After reviewing per-question results, look for these patterns:

**Consistent Primary mentions** — you have strong category association. Focus on maintaining this position with fresh content.

**Mixed results (some Primary, some None)** — your visibility is uneven. Examine the questions where you are missing. They likely represent content gaps or positioning weaknesses.

**Competitors appear, you don't** — the AI knows your category but not your brand. Prioritize building brand presence in the sources AI draws from (review sites, comparisons, authoritative publications).

**Nobody mentioned** — the AI doesn't associate specific brands with these questions. This is a first-mover opportunity; creating targeted content could establish your brand in this space.

## Running Multiple Audits

Run audits regularly to track trends:

- **Monthly cadence** — provides consistent data for trend analysis
- **After content changes** — measure the impact of new content after 4–8 weeks
- **Across models** — run separate audits for different AI models to compare visibility
- **Before and after campaigns** — establish baselines and measure campaign effectiveness

Each audit includes a timestamp so you can chart your AEO Score over time.

## Credit Cost

AEO Audits consume [Premium Credits](/reference/credit-system). Each plan includes monthly free audits:

| Plan | Free Monthly Audits | Additional Audit Cost |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Free | 1 (one-time) | — |
| Starter | 1 per month | 10 credits |
| Pro | Included | 10 credits |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Included |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is an AEO Audit?">
    An AEO Audit runs 20 category-neutral questions through an AI model and checks whether your brand appears in the responses. It produces an AEO Score (0–100) and a per-question breakdown showing your visibility across different question types.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are audit questions neutral?">
    Neutral questions (without your brand name) test organic visibility — whether AI naturally recommends you when users ask relevant questions. This mirrors real-world discovery behavior.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does an audit take?">
    Most audits complete in two to five minutes. The time depends on the AI model's response speed and current load.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I compare audits across different AI models?">
    Yes. Run separate audits against different models and compare results. Each audit is tagged with the model used, making cross-model comparison straightforward.
