## Overview

CiteScore's Content Generation feature produces articles, blog posts, landing pages, and other content optimized for AI citation. Every piece of generated content is informed by your [Brand Profile](/product/brand-profiles), Brand DNA, and voice guidelines to ensure relevance and consistency.

Generated content is designed to increase the probability that AI systems cite your brand when answering questions in your category.

## How Content Generation Works

Content generation follows a structured pipeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the brief">
    Specify the content type, target keyword, linked benchmark question (optional), and length. You can also provide advanced guidance including talking points, entities to mention, internal links, and exclusions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate outline">
    CiteScore produces an H1/H2/H3 structure based on your brief, Brand DNA, and target keyword. The outline is optimized for AI-readable structure with clear headings and logical flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate draft">
    The full article is generated following the outline, your brand's tone and voice, and AEO principles. Output includes the body text, meta description, URL slug, and FAQ section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and refine">
    Review the generated content, make edits, and regenerate sections as needed. Each piece includes an AEO score breakdown so you can see how well it is optimized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Content Types

CiteScore supports several content formats:

| Type | Use Case | AEO Benefit |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Blog post** | Topical authority, question-answer content | Covers category questions AI draws from |
| **Landing page** | Product positioning, feature pages | Establishes clear category association |
| **FAQ page** | Direct answers to common questions | Provides extractable answers for AI |
| **Comparison page** | Competitive positioning | Helps AI understand your differentiators |

## AEO Optimization Features

Generated content includes several AEO-specific elements:

### Direct-Answer Sections
Content leads with clear, concise answers that AI systems can extract and cite. No introductory filler — direct information first.

### Structured Headings
Headings are formatted as questions where natural (e.g., "How does X work?") to match the queries users ask AI assistants.

### FAQ Sections
Each piece includes a machine-readable FAQ section with question-answer pairs that AI systems can directly incorporate into responses.

### JSON-LD Structured Data
Generated content includes structured data suggestions (FAQ schema, Article schema) that help AI systems understand your content.

### Internal Link Recommendations
Content includes suggested internal links to strengthen your site's topical authority and help AI crawlers understand content relationships.

## Advanced Guidance

For more control over generated content, you can provide:

- **Talking points** — specific angles, arguments, or sections to include
- **Entities to mention** — companies, products, or concepts to reference naturally
- **Internal links** — URLs and anchor text for linking to your own content
- **Exclusions** — claims to avoid, competitors not to mention, tone constraints

Advanced guidance is combined with your Brand DNA and voice guidelines to produce content that matches your exact requirements.

## Content Clusters

Content Clusters organize related pieces into linked groups with a pillar page and supporting pages. Clusters help AI systems understand your topical authority by creating a structured web of interlinked content around a central theme.

Each cluster has:
- **Pillar page** — the main comprehensive page on the topic
- **Supporting pages** — focused pages covering specific subtopics
- **Link map** — the internal linking structure connecting pages within the cluster

## Content Status

Each content piece has a status that tracks its lifecycle:

- **Draft** — generated but not reviewed
- **Reviewed** — edited and approved
- **Published** — deployed to your site
