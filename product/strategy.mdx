## Overview

The Strategy feature generates a content strategy based on your [Brand Profile](/product/brand-profiles) and Brand DNA. It identifies keyword themes, question clusters, and recommended content types that can improve your brand's AI visibility.

A strategy provides the "what to create" roadmap. It answers: given your brand, your category, and how AI systems work, what content should you produce to increase the likelihood of being cited?

## How Strategy Generation Works

When you generate a strategy, CiteScore analyzes your Brand Profile and produces:

### Keyword Themes

Groups of related keywords that represent content opportunities in your category. Each theme identifies a topic area where content could improve your AI visibility.

Example for a project management tool:
- **Remote team collaboration** — remote work, distributed teams, async communication
- **Task management workflows** — sprint planning, kanban, task prioritization
- **Cross-functional projects** — stakeholder management, resource allocation

### Question Clusters

Groups of related questions that real users ask AI assistants about your category. These questions inform both content creation and [Benchmark Question](/product/benchmark-questions) sets.

Example:
- "What is the best tool for managing remote teams?"
- "How do I track tasks across multiple projects?"
- "What do product managers use for project planning?"

### Content Type Recommendations

Suggested content formats based on your category and positioning:

- **Blog posts** — for topical authority and question-answer content
- **Landing pages** — for category definition and competitive positioning
- **FAQ pages** — for direct-answer content that AI systems can cite
- **Comparison pages** — for competitive positioning
- **Use-case guides** — for audience-specific content

## Using Your Strategy

A generated strategy is a starting point. Use it to:

1. **Prioritize content creation** — focus on themes where your audit shows low visibility
2. **Inform benchmark questions** — use question clusters to build relevant test sets
3. **Guide content generation** — feed strategy themes into CiteScore's [content generator](/product/content-generation)
4. **Plan editorial calendars** — map themes to a publishing schedule

<Tip>
  Cross-reference your strategy with your [AEO Audit](/product/aeo-audits) results. Themes that align with questions where you scored poorly are your highest-priority content opportunities.

## Regenerating Strategy

You can regenerate your strategy at any time. Consider doing so when:

- You update your Brand Profile significantly
- Your competitive landscape changes
- Audit results reveal new gaps not covered by the current strategy
- You have exhausted the current set of content recommendations

Each regeneration consumes [Premium Credits](/reference/credit-system).
