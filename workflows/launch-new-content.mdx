---

## Overview

This workflow covers the process of taking a content idea from strategy through generation, optimization, publication, and verification. It ensures each piece of content is designed for AI citation from the start.

Use this workflow each time you create new content intended to improve your brand's AI visibility.

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Content Opportunity

Start with a clear reason for creating the content:

- A specific [benchmark question](/product/benchmark-questions) where your brand is not mentioned
- A keyword theme from your [Strategy](/product/strategy) that lacks coverage
- A [Website GEO Audit](/product/website-geo-audit) recommendation to add missing content
- A competitor advantage you want to counter

Document the target question or keyword, the intended audience, and the desired outcome before generating content.

### Step 2: Set Up the Content Brief

In CiteScore's [Content Generation](/product/content-generation) feature:

1. **Select content type** — blog post, landing page, FAQ page, or comparison
2. **Set target keyword** — the primary keyword this content should rank for
3. **Link a benchmark question** (optional) — connect to the specific question you are targeting
4. **Choose length** — short, medium, or long based on the topic's depth
5. **Add advanced guidance** — talking points, entities to mention, internal links, exclusions

<Tip>
  The more specific your brief, the more targeted the output. Include specific talking points, competitor context, and internal linking targets for the best results.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Generate and Review the Outline

CiteScore produces a structured outline with H1/H2/H3 headings. Review the outline for:

- Does it cover the question or topic comprehensively?
- Are headings structured as questions where appropriate?
- Does the flow make sense for the intended audience?
- Are there missing sections that should be included?

Edit the outline before proceeding to full content generation.

### Step 4: Generate the Full Draft

Generate the complete content piece. CiteScore produces:

- **Title and meta description** — optimized for both search and AI
- **URL slug** — clean, keyword-rich path
- **Body content** — full article following the outline and your brand voice
- **FAQ section** — structured Q&A pairs for AI extraction
- **Internal link suggestions** — recommended links to your own content
- **JSON-LD schema** — structured data for the page

### Step 5: Review for AEO Quality

Before publishing, verify the content follows AEO principles:

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Direct answers** | Does the content lead with clear, concise answers? |
| **Structured headings** | Are headings clear and question-formatted where natural? |
| **Entity clarity** | Is your brand name and category stated explicitly? |
| **FAQ section** | Are FAQ questions phrased as users would ask AI? |
| **No hype** | Is the tone factual and authoritative, not promotional? |
| **Internal links** | Does the content link to related pages on your site? |

CiteScore provides an AEO score breakdown for each piece — review the dimension scores (Content Structure, Entity Clarity, Answer Formatability, Semantic Richness) and address any low-scoring areas.

### Step 6: Publish

Deploy the content to your website:

1. **Publish to your domain** — content on your own site carries more weight for AI association
2. **Update your sitemap** — ensure the new page is included
3. **Add internal links** — link from existing pages to the new content
4. **Submit to search engines** — request indexing via Google Search Console
5. **Share through distribution channels** — email, social, partnerships

### Step 7: Verify AI Pickup

After 4–8 weeks, verify whether AI systems have picked up your content:

1. **Run an AEO Audit** focusing on the benchmark question this content targets
2. **Run a page-level GEO audit** on the new page to confirm its AI readiness score
3. **Check for improvements** in your overall AEO Score

If the targeted question still shows no improvement:
- Verify the page is indexed (check Google Search Console)
- Ensure no technical issues block crawlers
- Consider creating additional supporting content
- Build external mentions and backlinks to the page

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long should I wait before checking if AI picked up my content?">
    Allow 4–8 weeks. Retrieval-based models like Perplexity may reflect changes faster. Training-based models like ChatGPT may take longer depending on their update cycle.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I publish on my own site or on third-party platforms?">
    Publish the canonical version on your own domain. This strengthens your brand's association with the content. You can supplement with third-party distribution (guest posts, syndication) to build external mentions and authority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many content pieces should I create at once?">
    Quality matters more than quantity. Start with 2–3 targeted pieces addressing your highest-priority audit gaps. Measure impact before scaling up production.
