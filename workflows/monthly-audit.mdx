## Overview

The Monthly Audit Workflow is a recurring process for maintaining and improving your AI visibility over time. Rather than a one-time campaign, it establishes an ongoing cadence of measurement, analysis, and adjustment.

Running audits at consistent intervals gives you trend data that reveals whether your efforts are working, whether competitors are gaining ground, and where new opportunities are emerging.

## Monthly Cadence

### Week 1: Run Audits

At the beginning of each month:

1. **Run an AEO Audit** against your primary AI model
2. **Optionally run audits** against additional models (Gemini, Claude, Perplexity)
3. **Run a Website GEO Audit** if you have published new content since the last crawl

<Tip>
  Use the same benchmark question set each month for consistent trend tracking. Your core question set should remain stable; changes in scores then reflect actual visibility shifts, not question variations.
</Tip>

### Week 1–2: Analyze Results

Compare this month's results against previous months:

**Overall trends:**
- Is your AEO Score trending up, down, or flat?
- How has your mention rate changed?
- Has your average rank improved?

**Per-question analysis:**
- Which questions showed improvement?
- Which questions showed decline?
- Are there new questions where competitors gained visibility?

**Content correlation:**
- Did content published last month improve scores for its target questions?
- Are there content pieces that correlate with score improvements?

### Week 2–3: Adjust Strategy

Based on your analysis:

- **Reinforce successes** — if certain content improved specific question scores, create similar content for related questions
- **Address declines** — investigate why scores dropped (model updates, competitor content, or content changes)
- **Target new gaps** — identify questions that shifted from "mentioned" to "not mentioned" and prioritize them
- **Update strategy** — regenerate your [Strategy](/product/strategy) if the landscape has shifted significantly

### Week 3–4: Create Content

Generate and publish content targeting the gaps and opportunities identified in your analysis:

- Use [Content Generation](/product/content-generation) for new pieces
- Update existing pages based on [Website GEO Audit](/product/website-geo-audit) recommendations
- Ensure published content is properly indexed

## Tracking Your Progress

Maintain a record of key metrics each month:

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| **AEO Score** | Overall score trend (chart it monthly) |
| **Mention rate** | Percentage of questions with brand mentions |
| **Average rank** | Primary/Secondary/Listed distribution |
| **Competitor frequency** | How often specific competitors appear |
| **Content published** | Number and type of pieces published that month |

Over time, these records reveal the relationship between your content activities and AI visibility outcomes.

## Interpreting Trends

### Score Increasing Steadily
Your content strategy is working. Maintain the current approach and expand into adjacent topic areas.

### Score Flat Despite Activity
Check content quality and targeting. Are you addressing the right questions? Is your content reaching authoritative distribution channels? Consider expanding beyond on-site content to third-party mentions.

### Score Declining
Investigate potential causes: AI model updates, competitor activity, or content changes on your site. Run a fresh [Website GEO Audit](/product/website-geo-audit) to check for structural issues.

### Score Volatile (Up and Down)
Some variability is normal due to AI model randomness. Focus on the three-month trend rather than month-to-month changes. If volatility is extreme, check whether your benchmark questions are too narrow or ambiguous.

## Reporting

For teams that report on AI visibility as a channel metric:

- **Executive summary** — AEO Score trend, mention rate, key wins and losses
- **Competitive landscape** — which competitors are gaining or losing visibility
- **Content impact** — correlation between published content and score changes
- **Next month priorities** — planned content and expected impact areas

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often should I run audits?">
    Monthly audits provide the best balance of data freshness and meaningful change detection. AI models update periodically, and content takes time to influence results, so more frequent auditing may show noise rather than signal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I change my benchmark questions each month?">
    Keep your core question set stable for trend tracking. If you want to explore new areas, create a separate "exploratory" question set rather than modifying your core set.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have time to create content every month?">
    Not every month requires new content. Some months, your analysis may show that existing content is performing well. Focus creation effort on months where your audit reveals specific gaps or declines.
